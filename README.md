# To-Do-List App

#### Developed a dynamic and interactive to-do list application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. Implemented features such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, setting task priorities, and filtering tasks based on their status. Utilized React.js for component-based architecture and state management, and applied front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface and enable interactivity.
